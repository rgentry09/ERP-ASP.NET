English is the default laguage. But you can use other languages. You have to create a **CultureInfo** on the razor page and pass it as parameter in the contructor of the **GridClient** object:
    
```c#
    var locale = new CultureInfo("de-DE");
    var client = new GridClient<Order>(q => orderService.GetOrdersGridRows(columns, q), query, false, "ordersGrid", Columns, locale);
```
